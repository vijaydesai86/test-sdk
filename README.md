# Stock Research Assistant

An AI-powered stock research tool built on Next.js and GitHub Models. It produces institutional-quality equity research reports by combining real market data from free-tier financial APIs with LLM reasoning via GitHub Copilot or Gemini.

## What it does

Type a question in plain English and the assistant calls the right data tools, fetches real market data, and generates a structured report as a downloadable Markdown artifact.

**Three research modes:**

| Mode | How to ask | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| **Stock report** | `Generate a stock report for NVDA` | Full deep-dive: price, financials, earnings, insider activity, analyst ratings, technicals (RSI, MACD, Bollinger, Stochastic), dividend analysis, DCF valuation, moat analysis, investment thesis |
| **Research report** | `Compare NVDA, AMD, INTC` · `Deep research on semiconductors` · `Best dividend stocks` · `Tesla vs Rivian` | Handles any multi-company, sector, theme, industry, or research question. Fetches verified core market data first, then adds ecosystem/dependency synthesis when budget allows |
| **Watchlist daily** | `Generate daily report for my watchlist` | One combined report covering every company in the saved watchlist |

**Transparent decision engine:**

Every report includes a multi-factor decision for each company, powered by a 7-pillar scoring model:

| Pillar | Weight | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| Profitability | 25% | Gross margin, operating margin, ROE, ROA |
| Valuation | 20% | P/E ratio, analyst target upside |
| Growth | 15% | Revenue growth, EPS growth |
| Momentum | 15% | Price trend over observation period |
| Analyst Consensus | 15% | Weighted buy/hold/sell distribution |
| Insider Activity | 5% | Net insider buying as % of market cap (no fixed $ thresholds) |
| Financial Health | 5% | Debt/equity, current ratio, cash flow |

The decision summary shows the **real data behind each score** so you can see exactly how the Buy/Hold/Sell recommendation was reached. If critical pillars are missing, the engine withholds a buy/add score and waits for verified inputs instead of forcing a decision from one partial signal.

**Additional research tools** (use via natural language questions):

| Tool | How to ask | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| **Technical analysis** | `What are the technical indicators for AAPL?` | RSI(14), MACD(12,26,9), Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, ATR, EMA, SMA, volume analysis |
| **SEC filings** | `Show me recent SEC filings for TSLA` | Recent 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K filings with dates and links to SEC EDGAR |
| **Economic indicators** | `What are the current economic indicators?` | GDP, CPI/inflation, Fed Funds rate, unemployment, Treasury yields, yield curve |
| **Dividend analysis** | `Analyze dividends for KO` | Yield, payout ratio, FCF coverage, safety score, ex-dividend dates |
| **DCF valuation** | `What's the intrinsic value of MSFT?` | 10-year DCF, WACC, margin of safety, valuation verdict |
| **Market sentiment** | `What's the market sentiment right now?` | Composite Fear & Greed index (0-100) from real market data |
| **Theme news search** | `Find recent semiconductor news` | Recent market/news articles for a company, sector, or investment theme |

## Quick start (local development)

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, a GitHub token with `models:read` scope or a Gemini API key, at least one stock data API key.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vijaydesai86/test-sdk.git
cd test-sdk/web
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in your keys
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Environment variables

Copy `web/.env.example` to `web/.env.local` and fill in the values. All variables that default to a sensible value are optional.

### LLM providers (at least one required)

The system **automatically uses all configured providers in sequence** — GitHub Models first (exhausting all fallback models), then Gemini. No configuration needed; just set the tokens and everything is used.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Recommended | Personal access token from [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Requires `models:read` scope. Uses your existing GitHub Copilot subscription at no extra cost. Also accepted: `GH_TOKEN`, `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`. |
| `GEMINI_TOKEN` | Recommended | API key from [aistudio.google.com/api-keys](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys). Use AI Studio — not Google Cloud Console — to get free-tier quota automatically. |
| `COPILOT_MODEL` | No | Preferred first GitHub Models ID. Default: `openai/gpt-4.1`. After that the server fans out across the full live GitHub catalog automatically. |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | No | Preferred first Gemini model ID. Default: `gemini-2.5-flash`. Invalid values are ignored and reset to the safe Gemini ladder automatically. |
| `COPILOT_FALLBACK_MODELS` | No | Optional comma-separated GitHub model IDs to try near the front of the automatic fallback ladder. |
| `FILL_MODEL` | No | Lighter model used for ticker resolution. Default: `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`. |
| `AUTO_DOWNGRADE_GPT5` | No | Set to `false` to disable automatic gpt-5 → gpt-4.1 downgrade. Default: `true`. |

### Stock data providers (at least one required)

The system **automatically uses all configured providers with full fallback** — each API call tries every configured provider until data is returned. No `STOCK_DATA_PROVIDER` selection needed.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` | Recommended | Free key from [alphavantage.co](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). Free tier: 25 req/day, 5 req/min. |
| `FINNHUB_API_KEY` | Recommended | Free key from [finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io). Free tier: 60 req/min. |
| `FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_API_KEY` | No | Free key from [financialmodelingprep.com](https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs). Adds financial statements and ratios. |
| `TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY` | No | Free key from [twelvedata.com](https://twelvedata.com/pricing). Adds price history coverage. |

_Stooq (price history, no key needed) is always included as a final fallback._

### Additional data sources (optional — enable extra research tools)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FRED_API_KEY` | No | Free key from [fred.stlouisfed.org](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html). Enables the `get_economic_indicators` tool (GDP, CPI, Fed Funds rate, unemployment, Treasury yields, yield curve). |

_Note: SEC EDGAR filings (`get_sec_filings`) require no API key — the SEC EDGAR API is completely free._

### Persistence (optional — filesystem fallback used when not set)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL. When set with `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, reports and watchlists persist in Supabase; local filesystem report files remain available as artifact fallback. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase service-role key (server-side only, never expose to browser). |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Optional deployment parity variable. Current server routes do not require it, but it is safe to keep in Vercel envs if already configured. |

### Tuning (all optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NUM_COMPANIES` | `10` | Companies in comparison/sector/deep-sector reports. Range: 2–15. |
| `DEEP_RESEARCH_MAX_MS` | `240000` on Vercel, `600000` local | Runtime budget for deep research (ms). Vercel is clamped under the 300 s function limit; local can run longer for completeness. |
| `DATA_FETCH_CONCURRENCY` | `3` | Parallel ticker fetches per report round. Range: 1–4. |
| `VERCEL_EXTENDED_DATA_MAX_COMPANIES` | `3` | On Vercel, reports larger than this prioritize core decision inputs and cached optional data so free-tier providers do not consume the whole 300 s function window. Local runs still attempt extended data. |
| `REPORTS_DIR` | `reports` (local) / `/tmp/reports` (Vercel) | Where generated report files are stored. |
| `STOCK_CACHE_TTL_MS` | `604800000` (7 days) | How long fetched data is cached on disk. |
| `LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `60000` on Vercel, `90000` local | Per-request LLM timeout before trying the next model/provider. |
| `LLM_MODEL_COOLDOWN_MS` | `120000` | How long a rate-limited LLM model is skipped before retrying. |
| `STOCK_PROVIDER_COOLDOWN_MS` | `300000` | How long a rate-limited data provider is paused. |
| `ALPHA_VANTAGE_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | `12000` | Min ms between Alpha Vantage requests. Matches the documented 5 req/min free-tier ceiling. |
| `FINNHUB_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | `1100` | Min ms between Finnhub requests. Keeps the default under the documented 60 req/min free-tier ceiling. |
| `FMP_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | `12000` | Min ms between FMP requests. Uses a conservative default for the free-tier minute quota. |
| `TWELVE_DATA_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | `8000` | Min ms between Twelve Data requests. Keeps the default under the documented 8 req/min free-tier ceiling. |
| `STOOQ_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | `1000` | Min ms between Stooq requests. Conservative no-key fallback pacing. |
| `GITHUB_MODELS_CACHE_TTL_MS` | `900000` (15 min) | Cache TTL for the live GitHub Models catalog so every chat request does not re-fetch the catalog. |
| `DEBUG` | `false` | Set to `true` to show data-source and data-coverage sections in reports. |
| `HEALTH_CHECK_SYMBOL` | — | Optional ticker for a live price check in the `/api/health` response. |

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push your fork to GitHub.
2. Create a new Vercel project and import the repository.
3. In Vercel project settings, set **Root Directory** to `web`.
4. Add the environment variables listed above under **Settings → Environment Variables**.
5. Deploy. The build command (`npm run build`) and output directory (`.next`) are pre-configured in `vercel.json`.

**Recommended production environment variables:**

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_pat
GEMINI_TOKEN=your_gemini_key
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_av_key
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_key
NUM_COMPANIES=15
```

### Supabase setup (optional but recommended for Vercel)

Vercel's filesystem is ephemeral — reports and watchlists written to `/tmp` are lost on each function invocation. To persist them, connect a Supabase project:

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Open the SQL editor and run the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` in order.
3. Copy the project URL and service-role key to Vercel environment variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`).

## Running tests

```bash
# From the repo root
npm test
```

Tests live in `__tests__/` and cover tool routing, report generation, and data service behaviour.

---

## Health check

```
GET /api/health
```

Returns the configured provider mode, which API keys are present, and whether the service is ready to handle requests. Pass `HEALTH_CHECK_SYMBOL=AAPL` to include a live price check in the response.
